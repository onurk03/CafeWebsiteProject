<ins>About</ins>

I'm trying to build a concept caf√© website for practice purposes. The finished project will have a "home" page, a "menu" page, and a functional "order" page.
I will be learning about different layout styles, javascript implementations, and reponsive web design as I progress.

Implemented a way of storing the user's cart and the number of items inside it to their local storage. 

5 minutes after adding their last item, the user is alerted with a custom pop-up that says "You haven't checked out in 5 minutes, your cart information will disappear after 25 minutes." 30 Minutes after adding their last item, the user's cart information will be erased from the local storage. 

Next thing to do is to implement the check-out page so that the items that are added to the cart can be displayed properly for a check-out system. I might make occasional improvements with the front-end structure of the website when I see flaws.
