I'm trying to build a responsive caf√© website that has a "home" page, a "menu" page, and an "order" page.

- The home page includes an "About" section about the restaurant and all the other pages include a "Contact Us" section
on the bottom as a footer. 

(1/12/22) <ins>Update:</ins> Implemented a JS back-end so that items can be added to the cart as objects with name, price, and quantity values. The amount of items added to the cart will pop up on the top-right of the cart icon as a bubble. Next thing to do is to implement the check-out page so that the items that are added to the cart can be displayed properly for a check-out system.. I might make occasional improvements with the front-end structure of the website when I see flaws.
