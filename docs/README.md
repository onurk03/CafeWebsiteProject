# CafeWebsiteProject
<ins>About</ins>

I'm trying to build a concept caf√© website for practice purposes. The finished project will have a "home" page, a "menu" page, and a functional "order" page.
I will be learning about different layout styles, javascript implementations, and reponsive web design as I progress.

This website is now completed, I might add occasional styles, commenting or small changes.
