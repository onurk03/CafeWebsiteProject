# CafeWebsiteProject
I'm trying to build a responsive caf√© website that has a "home" page, a "menu" page, and an "order" page.

- The home page includes an "About" section about the restaurant and all the other pages include a "Contact Us" section
on the bottom as a footer. 

(1/11/22) <ins>Update:</ins> At this point the website has everything except the back-end of the "order" page completed. I'm planning on implementing this using Javascript, but I still need to learn some things before I can complete this part. I might make occasional improvements with the front-end structure of the website when I see flaws.
