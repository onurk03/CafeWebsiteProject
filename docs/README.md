# CafeWebsiteProject
I'm trying to build a responsive caf√© website that has a "home" page, a "menu" page, and an "order" page.

- The home page includes an "About" section about the restaurant and all the other pages include a "Contact Us" section
on the bottom as a footer. 

<ins>Update:</ins> At this point the website has everything except the "order" page completed. I still need to work on making the navigation bar responsive for mobile phones. Once I learn more about back-end programming I'm planning on using Javascript and Java to implement this page and make it functional.
